Views for the auth_api application.

This module contains views related to user authentication and authorization 
in the To-Do List application. The views are built using Django REST Framework (DRF).
They handle tasks such as user login, registration, and token-based authentication
using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).

The views process HTTP requests and provide appropriate responses for managing 
user credentials and access control.
